<h1>ChatServerClient</h1> 
<p>This is an example client for my ChatAppServer.</br>
App allows users to communicate by messages through the server.</br>
The process of receiveing messages is asynchronous so that client isn't interrupted by incoming messages or doesnt have to put messages in ceratin order.
